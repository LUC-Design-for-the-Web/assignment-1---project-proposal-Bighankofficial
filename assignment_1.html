            <h2>Inspiration for this Site</h2>
            <p>At one point in time, ceiling lights and desk lamps were the pinnacle of office lighting. But then, the designers at <a href="https://razer.com/store">Razer</a> decided to take things to the next level as they introduced RGB into all of their tech designs. On their site, you will find a dark atmosphere where they are able to highlight the amazing features of RGB lighting. This is where I found inspiration to bring you Neon Design Inc.
